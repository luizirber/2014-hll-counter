    abstract = "<p>K-mer abundance analysis is widely used for many purposes in
nucleotide sequence analysis, including data preprocessing for de novo
assembly, repeat detection, and sequencing coverage estimation. We present the
khmer software package for fast and memory efficient <italic>online</italic>
counting of k-mers in sequencing data sets. Unlike previous methods based on
data structures such as hash tables, suffix arrays, and trie structures, khmer
relies entirely on a simple probabilistic data structure, a Count-Min Sketch.
The Count-Min Sketch permits online updating and retrieval of k-mer counts in
memory which is necessary to support online k-mer analysis algorithms. On
sparse data sets this data structure is considerably more memory efficient than
any exact data structure. In exchange, the use of a Count-Min Sketch introduces
a systematic overcount for k-mers; moreover, only the counts, and not the
k-mers, are stored. Here we analyze the speed, the memory usage, and the
miscount rate of khmer for generating k-mer frequency distributions and
retrieving k-mer counts for individual k-mers. We also compare the performance
of khmer to several other k-mer counting packages, including Tallymer,
Jellyfish, BFCounter, DSK, KMC, Turtle and KAnalyze. Finally, we examine the
effectiveness of profiling sequencing error, k-mer abundance trimming, and
digital normalization of reads in the context of high khmer false positive
rates. khmer is implemented in C++ wrapped in a Python interface, offers a
tested and robust API, and is freely available under the BSD license at
github.com/ged-lab/khmer.</p>",
